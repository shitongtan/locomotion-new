## Locomotion - Android Mobile Application 
### Main Functionalities
1. Sensors integration for improved accuracy of user localization 
2. Map Matching of routes for better visualization
3. Elevation and movement detection of the users 

#### Instructions to Run: 
- Clone/Download project files 
- Build and run 'app' using Android Studio IDE, on your mobile device emulator (location services must be turned on)

#### This project file contains 2 main directories
- app - Interfaces, Loggers, Presenters
- locomotion - Commons, Filters (GeoHash, GPSAccKalmanFilter, KalmanFilter, MadgwickAHRS), SensorAux (Calibrator), Services (KalmanLocationService)

#### Tools/Software used:
- Android Studio IDE
- Mapbox Maps API : Navigations and Directions
- Mapbox Maps SDK
  
#### Full functionalities can be used on an Android Mobile Device with 
- GPS
- Accelerometer
- Gyroscope
- Magnetic Field Sensor
- Barometer

#### These sensors provide the app with data points to improve user localization accuracy.
